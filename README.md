# Portfolio Karen Lobin Perkins

This is my original portfolio after completing the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly in Autumn 2020.

This site is built in HTML, pure CSS, and Javascript. As of the end of October 2020, it showcases the four unit projects I built while at GA. Updated in January 2021, to include passion project _Despejado_ built in December 2020.
