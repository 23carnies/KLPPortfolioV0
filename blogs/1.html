		<div class="section" id="confidence">
			<h2>Confidence</h2>
			<div class="section__box">
				<p>Confidence is faked until you have it. To gain confidence over gaps in your background, first you have to decide
					where you are trying to go. You have to pick a job title you are aiming for. Then, go to LinkedIn. Look at job
					descriptions for this title.
			
					The keywords and skills listed are what you should be working on. Make a list of all the skills you see in
					several
					listings. You can make a wordcloud of your findings <a href="https://www.wordclouds.com/">here</a>.
			
					The biggest words are the skills you need to focus on most. Have some knowledge of the other words in the cloud
					so
					you can talk your way through the interview.</p>

			<h2>The Informational Interview</h2>
			<div class="section__box">
				<p>These are things to ask someone who works at a company you want to apply to before you actually apply there. You're
					not
					asking them for help or an interview or anything else. Just some general info. My husband has assured me that people
					love to talk, and most people will be happy to oblige these simple conversations.</p>
				<p>Things to ask:
					<ul>
						<li>What do you do?</li>
						<li>How do you accomplish that?</li>
						<li>How does someone like me get to where you are?</li>
						<li>Do you like the culture?</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Failure</h2>
			<p>It's good to know where you are in your career, know the terrain, and know how to open doors. Know what to do when
				you hit that first glass door <span>failure</span>.
				<br>
				Shanae says she fails all the time because she takes risk. Risk in the jobs she has chosen, picking between a safe
				bet and a crazy risky role. Know and expect failure because it absolutely will happen. Know that it will still suck even
				when you expect it.
				<br>
				Sometimes that risk was taking jobs she knew would be toxic. It is easier to make change from the inner circle. So
				if you're up for it, you can take the job where you are an absolute outsider and fight your way through. You learn to
				navigate people's expectations and preconceived notions about you. Dispel them as quickly as possible and try to
				overcome the pattern-matching that others put on you.
				<br>
				Everyone handles failure differently. You may need to self care for a few days. You may be able to jump right back
				in. Scott shared that his mother would set a 22 minute timer. "You have 22 minutes to feel bad about this. Scream, cry,
				get it out." When the timer goes off, it's back to work. Put it behind you.
				<br>
				On a personal note, in rowing, we have bad strokes all the time. Everyone in the boat knows it was you. It's
				embarrassing. You have to immediately forget the bad strokes or else they just permeate all the next ones.</p>
		
			<h2>Do code challenges every day</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="mentor">
			<h2>Mentors</h2>
		
			<p>Mentors give you an easy path to help you map out a career trajectory. It helps to find someone who mirrors your
				identity. Look for mentors everywhere: in your industry, not in your industry, a couple steps ahead of you, possibly
				younger than you are. Be involved in their lives as much as you can, not just when you need advice. Have a million
				mentors, but also, don't underestimate the power of peer-to-peer relationships.
			
				Finding a mentor:
				<ul>
					<li>Network at conferences and follow up to ask to connect again</li>
					<li>Reach out to industry experts on Github after learning about their work via a presentation (i.e. YouTube)</li>
					<li>Cold networking on LinkedIn</li>
					<li>or use sites like <a href="https://rocketreach.co/">rocketreach.co</a> to get email addresses</li>
					<li>Don't just look for a mentor, look for a sponsor as well</li>
					<li>A mentor will give you advice from above</li>
					<li>A sponsor will pull you up to their level</li>
					<li>Find your board of directors</li>

			<h2>Your non technical background is NOT a disadvantage</h2>
		
			<p>We are all amateurs. There are no professionals in this industry, there are people that are learning faster. Having
				a CS
				degree from 20 years ago means you learned a lot of stuff that is not in use now. You have to learn how to learn and
				how to not give up. Everyone feels like a phony. Are you paying attention? Do you know more than you did last week?
			
				The <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/31572054-the-imposter-s-handbook">Imposter's Handbook</a> was written by a guy with a geology degree who became a great programmer. Imposter syndrome
				is real. See the confidence section above.</p>

			<h2 id="social">Social Developer</h2>
		
			<p>Get <a href="https://getinvolved.hanselman.com/">involved</a>. Blogging. Twitter. Github. Stack Overflow. User Groups. YouTube. Twitch. Podcasts. Speaking.
		
			You don't have to do all of them. But pick one or two. You don't need to be an expert on the thing you are
			blogging/tweeting/youtubing about. These are your journey and the things you are working on.</p>
		
			<h3>Blogging</h3>
		
				<p>	Take notes on what you are already doing and document it. You are creating an artifact that honors what you are
					working on. You don't need to have thousands of followers to be a blogger. You are keeping a record for yourself. If you
					blog your notes on a site that you own, you'll be able to search yourself and the topic and find your notes easily.</p>
					<p>It is a living resume. Blogging is proof of your technical writing ability. It is also the ability for you to answer
					a question in perpetuity. If you answer a question by email, text, or other messaging service, that answer only lives
					in that private space. If you write a short blogpost about it, the answer is out there for anyone else with the same
					question.</p>
					<p>
					Putting your blog on your own site will allow you to make commits and boost your Github stats. You can host your
					site for free on Github Pages. There is also a way to get free hosting on azure. It may be slightly complicated, but you
					will have some cloud knowledge to put on your resume as well.</p>
		
			<h3 id="three-ways">Three ways of thinking of code</h3>
		
			<h4>Systematic Thinking, Syntax, Text Editing</h4>
		
			<p>Systematic thinking is asking yes/no questions at scale. Early in your career you google a lot; later in your career
				you
				ask questions that eliminate large numbers of problems at once.
			
			<img src="../resources/blogImages/systematicThinking.png" alt="">
			<figcaption>Image by Scott Hanselmann</figcaption>
			<br>
				Syntax is the code itself. Learn the code. Know the code.
			
				Text editing is how we move around text. We all go crazy when that one person takes seven mouseclicks to copy/paste
				one thing. Learn the keyboard shortcuts in whatever program or website you are on. They are often similar. Gmail has
				shortcuts. Github has shortcuts. Customize your VSCode. Did you know if you hit ctrl + g + <i>number&nbsp;</i> you will go to that line of code??
					Learn to customize VSCode <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/customize-vs-code/">here</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="hiring">The Hiring Process</h2>
	
			<p>Rethinking how we interview in Microsoft's Developer Division article <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/rethinking-how-we-interview-in-microsofts-developer-division-8f404cfd075a">here</a>.
	
				Microsoft is in the process of losing whiteboarding from interviews. Instead, the process will be a take-home
				assignment brought back after a couple of days and then explained fully. This more realistically mimics the work
				environment.
		
				Pair programming, a senior dev using LiveCode with an interviewee is also becoming more common.
		
				It is on all of us to to demand the interviewing process that we all would like to have. While that may not be
				possible when you are out of work and rent is due, whenever possible we should question things that seem
				ridiculous.
		
				If you are in an interview with a lot of whiteboarding, politely ask if there is a lot of whiteboarding in the
				job
				itself?
		
				A <a href="https://github.com/poteto/hiring-without-whiteboards">list</a> of companies that do not do whiteboarding in interviews
		
				As a career changer, we need to be honest about the gaps in our knowledge. If you get a question about bubble sort and you don' know what it is, tell them, "I don't have a CS degree. I'm going to end up googling bubble sort." Justown it.
		
				However, if you have done your wordcloud from earlier, you may have at least heard of some stuff that comes up in the interview. Reinforce what you DO know. "I have heard of data binding but I don't know much about it. I have
				worked in MVC pattern and am comfortable with it. I can learn data binding in short order."

			<h3 id="interview">The Interview Loop</h3>
	
			<p>How to get passed the application and to the actual interview
			</p>
			<h3>Send hundreds of resumes</h3>
	
			<p>We are in a very competitive market. Blast out as many applications as you can no matter the job or the company.
				Don't worry about the long list of asks on the job listing. It is possible that the engineer who wrote that list
				is
				fearful of their own position. So if you don't know Angular, Vue, C#, Java, Sass, LESS, *and* Go, it's ok. Apply
				anyway. The worst that happens is a really bad interview. Those are going to happen anyway.
		</p>
			<h3>The Warm Intro</h3>
	
			<p>The warm intro can get your resume to the top. It won't get you the interview but it can get eyeballs on your
				resume.</p>
	
			<p><b>Networking to get the warm intro:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Be in spaces where people want to bring you in. Be visible. Meetups. Accelerators. Hackathons.</li>
					<li>Volunteer in a public way</li>
					<li>Let people know how to help you. Tell them what you are looking to do.</li>
					<li>If a recruiter talks to you about a position you are not interested in, tell them, "I am interested in jobs with this title."</li>
					<li>This process may take longer than you think</li>
					<li>Lean in on your expertise, let that help you stand out</li>
					<li>Sometimes hiring is based on a specific goal. You won't know that goal when you're applying, but you may be the intersection they are looking for. Let people know your intersection</li>
					<li>The way to use LinkedIn is to get off LinkedIn. Get to know this person. Have conversations. When you are able to talk to them by text or Whatsapp, they know you. People who know you will give you the warm intro.</li>
					<li>Use <a href="https://lunchclub.com/?invite_code=danb17">Lunch Club</a> to connect with people and get to know them.</li>
				</ul>
	
			Be unapologetic about being early in this career. Let them know you don't know everything, but you want to.
			Know that it is okay to take a second to think about an interview question before answering.
			Also, don't filter your applications by the places you want to work for. Take the interview. Always take the
			interview. It's great practice. And just like a new standup comedian, YOU WILL BOMB. Better to bomb at a company
			you're not fired up about for a position that is above your head. Learn resilience. Set a timer, feel shitty for
			x amount of time, then put your big girl panties on and let's get to work.
				<br>
			After the interview, when you start getting offers, then you can filter by how you feel about the company and their values.

			<h2>Projects, Practice, Open Source</h2>
			<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
			<p>Build projects that solve problems. The problem itself doesn't matter.
				<ul>
					<li>A program that shoots squirrels with a water gun when they are eating the tomatoes</li>
					<li>A raspberry pi connected to the garage that tells me when I left the door open</li>
					<li>An easy button that orders pizza</li>
					<br>Find beginner's Python videos <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/opensource/2019/09/19/new-python-training-video-series-beginners/">here</a>.
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
			<p>Working on OpenSource projects is a great way to keep your Github stats green. It's good practice in pull
				requests
				and working on established code. There are often opportunities to do documentation as a first step if you're not
				ready for actual code.
				<br>This site is to help first time OpenSource contributors: <a href="https://www.firsttimersonly.com/">First Timers Only</a></p>
				
				<h3>Practice</h3> 
				<p>Repetitive motion builds muscle memory. Practice.
					<ul>
					Sites good for practicing:
						<li><a href="http://codekata.com/">CodeKata</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a></li>
					</ul>
